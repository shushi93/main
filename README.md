Some of the python codes will be compiled into an executable for the demo (in Summer of Making) <br>
Feel free to download and try them out (no they don't have a virus, it is the same code as what is in the source code file) <br>
The first one is located in: **CS50/CS50P/Problem Set 7/response** <br> 

**Installation Steps**<br>
For those who don't know how to donwload exe files, click on releases (or go to https://github.com/shushi93/main/releases), then download the exe file listed (you do not need to download the other files, though you can if you want to).
